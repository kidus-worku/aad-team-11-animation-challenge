## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Motivation:
  #### We built this app for a team challenge on Animations for android, designated to us by Andela Learning Community 4 - Google Africa Developer Scholarship. 

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è App Idea:
  #### Multiple Questions Trivia App.

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è App Detail:
  This App is a simple **trivia game!** it contains challenging multiple questions with 10 different catagories.
  Questions are fetched from [The Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com).You get 11 questions (*because we are team 11..üòä*) For each quetion you get 25 seconds to answer or it will move on to the next question.
  
  There are 3,489 VERIFIED QUESTIONS in the [Free to use, user-contributed trivia question database](https://opentdb.com). From which this app utilizes about 60% of them, so you have an abundance of mind boggling questions to have fun with.
